A very simple tool that counts the frequency of words/charcter in a text file.

To use this place the text in the file "text.txt" and run the program, "words.py" to count the frequency of the words in the text, use "charcter.py" to count the frequency of the characters in the text. The output will be in the file "chars_count.txt" or "words_count.txt" depending on the program run.

Additionally clear.py can be used to clear out the output txt file (This is normally not nessessary as the program clears the contents of the file when it is ran).
